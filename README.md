# POT-HOLE-DETECTION-YOLOV5



### Overview : 
The purpose of this project is to create a Deep Learning model and this dataset could be used for automatically finding and categorizing potholes in city streets so the worst ones can be fixed faster.


### üìÅ Dataset Used : 
https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pothole
 

**This dataset consist of only one class: (Pothole)**



# Workflow:
  ## Data Preparation:
  * Total 465 images for training and 133 images for validation present in 2 classes.
  * Create a bounding boxes with the help of label-img And makesense.ai website according to YoloV5.
  * Prepare folder structure that can be accept by YoloV5.

## Steps to use Yolov5:
* Cloning the YoloV5 file from official repository.
* Changing the directory of yolov5
* Installing the dependencies
* Download all versions pre-trained weights.

 ## Steps Before Training Custom Dataset:
* Go to yolov5/data/.
* Open data.yaml
* Edit the following inside it:

 1. Training and Validation file path
 2. Number of classes and Class names.

  ## Training YOLOV5 Model
* Set images size 640 with batch of 8.
* Train model around 600 epochs .
* Visualise the training metrics with the help of tensorboard.
